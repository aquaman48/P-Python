## Hello

<br />

Welcome to my *Python* sandbox! If you take a look around you will see that the files here that I put together vary in from basics to actual programs that do some pretty cool stuff.

I like the versatility that the Python language comes with. There are a lot of interesting things we can do. Experimentation is always a great way to learn.

### The_Basics:

<br />

In [this](https://github.com/aquaman48/Python/tree/main/The_Basics) directory I have most of the basics of Python here. Varying in with working with list, dictionaries, etc... For the most part I have a good variety of files to be checked out here.
