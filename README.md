## Hello

<br />

Welcome to my *Python* sandbox! If you take a look around you will see that the files here that I put together vary in from basics to actual programs that do some pretty cool stuff.

I like the versatility that the Python language comes with. There are a lot of interesting things we can do. Experimentation is always a great way to learn. 

<br />

### The_Basics:

<br />

In [this](https://github.com/aquaman48/Python/tree/main/The_Basics) directory I have most of the basics of Python here. Varying in with working with list, dictionaries, etc... For the most part I have a good variety of files to be checked out here. 

<br />

### Rain:

<br />
This was a challenge that I took on from 

[Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/PythonCrashCourse2ndEdition/dp/1593279280/ref=sr_1_1dchild=1&keywords=9781593279295&linkCode=qs&qid=1618626455&s=books&sr=1-1). <br />
The gist of this is to make it look like the <br />
"raindrops" are falling vertically on users screen. Some really neat stuff. 

<br />

### Side_Game/Space_Shooter:

<br />

These directories are very similiar. The differences are that in Space_Shooter it has a vertical layout whereas Side_Game is horizontal. Space_Shooter is one of my first projects that I actually started on.
